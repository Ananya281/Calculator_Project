## Git & GitHub Workflow (Assignment Requirement) 

During this assignment, the following Git steps were performed:

1. Initialized a local repository
2. Connected it to the remote GitHub repository
3. Made the first commit and pushed it to the main branch
4. Created a new branch named ui-update and made small UI changes
5. Created another branch named content-update, and intentionally edited the same line
6. Merged ui-update into main successfully
7. Merged content-update next, which caused a merge conflict
8. Manually resolved the conflict and committed the final version

This helped in understanding branching, merging, and resolving conflicts in distributed version control.

## How to Run

Just open the file in any web browser:
```
index.html
```
